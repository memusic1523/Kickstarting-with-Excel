Analysis of the Outcomes Based on Launch Date

##Overview of Project
For this project I needed to analysis the Outcomes based on Goals and Outcomes based on Launch date.

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is so Louise will be able to know how much she will need for her campaign. As well as when should she start her campaign.

##Analysis of Outcome Based on Launch Date
If you see the line graph(below) you will see that the Outcomes Based on Lauch Date that the most succcessful month to start a campaign is May.

##Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals
If you see the line graph(below) you will see that the outcomes less than 1000 has the highest succes but also in the range of 35000 to 39999 is steady. The failed outcomes are in the range 25000 to 29999 and 45000 to 49999.

##Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges I had were the Countifs function. I overcame it with watching videos several times over and understanding the meaning. The hint video just confuse me more than I already was. I was finally able to populate the "Number Successful", "Number Failed", "Number Cancel". 

##Results
The two conclusion I can draw about the Outcomes based on Lauch Date is that May is the best time to start a campaign and that 

I can concluded that the Outcomes based on Goals has more ranges of success. I say this because you can campaign for an amount of either less than 1000 or 35000 to 44999.
Some limitation of this dataset is that the subcategory is plays, the US, and that we are not include live campaigns.
A possible table/graph I can creater is a box plot.
